# Documentation

This folder contains documentation about upm, including usage, development (see the `dev/` folder), and various other documentation.

Note that due to the rapidly changing nature of upm, certain docs could be outdated, and some could be future documentation meant to aid in development of abstract features (read: bring more people in through hacktoberfest, at the time of writing).
