# Installing a package

Note: this document does NOT refer to installing upm. See [TODO: document upm installation]

Installing packages is done through `upm install package@version`. There's a few syntactical markers supported:

* `latest` - try to resolve the latest version and download it. Some packages may not support this
* `lts` - get the LTS version. Only possible for packages that have an LTS version, and that also have an easy way to determine what the LTS is

Some packages may have additional semantic markers. [TODO: document]

`version` may also be a proper version `1.2.3`.
